# Graphviz Graph Generator

## Overview

This tool is a command-line application that generates graph visualizations in SVG format using Graphviz. It takes node and edge data as input and produces a directed graph.

## Features

* **Graph Visualization:** Generates SVG graphs from user-provided node and edge data.
* **Customizable Node and Edge Data:**
    * Nodes are defined with a name, path, synopsis, and URL.
    * Edges are defined by the names of the source and target nodes, and can optionally include a relation, color, and style.
* **DOT Language Output:** Can optionally output the generated DOT language representation of the graph for debugging.
* **Configuration:**
    * Supports a configuration file (generated by the `-genconfig` option) to customize graph settings.
    * Command-line flags to override configuration settings.
* **Styling:** Supports styling of graphs, nodes, and edges (e.g., background color, font, colors, styles).
* **Error Handling:** Provides error messages for invalid node or edge data formats.
* **Version Information:** Includes a `-version` flag to display the application version.
